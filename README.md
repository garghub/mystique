The repo contains the data for the paper _Vulnerability Mimicking Mutants_.

The paper is available here: [![Paper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-arXiv-blue)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04247)

The bib entry for citing the paper is available here: [![Cite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cite-BibTex-green.svg)](mystique.bib)

Please note that we employed [Vul4J](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9796326) for our study. Hence, the naming convention of the directories is in accordance, for which we provide the [mapping](directory_mappings.txt). 

The data consists of the following:

1) The source code of all projects both, [vulnerable](code) and [fixed](fixed_code) in zipped format. Please note that there can be multiple zip files of 100 MB each for a single project based on its size;

2) The individual classes modified during the fix as [patches](patches), i.e., both, vulnerable and fixed;

3) The individual [fixed](fixes_for_mutation) classed that were mutated;

4) All the [mutants](mutants_mbert) for every project generated by [ÂµBert](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icstw/2022/962800a160/1E2wucGg7Ac);

5) The separated vulnerability-fix information including sentence-level changes, commit date, etc. in [patches](patches) directory;

6) _Mystique's_ scripts combined together in a single python [script](all_scripts_combined_together.py).
